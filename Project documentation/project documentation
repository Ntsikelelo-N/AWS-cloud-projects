# Step-by-Step Execution
## Set up an IAM user
Open the AWS management console from your root user and create a user, by navigating to **IAM**. Navigate to **Users**. Choose create user and name the user what you want. Attach administrator access policy to the user. AFter the user has been created, click on the name of your user, underneath the **summary** click on **Create access key**. Choose **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, click **next** at the bottom of the screen. Add description for the tag, and click **Create access key**. You can download the generated access key on the next page in csv format. Keep this information safe as it allows a user to access to you AWS resources via the command line.

For extra security, it is recommended to set up MFA device, which adds an additional layer of safety to keep your account safe.

## Download the AWS CLI
Navigate to [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) to install/update your AWS CLI. This is going to be helpful to access the AWS services via management console.

## Accessing the AWS resources programmatically
Open a terminal of your choice on your device. Run the command `aws configure`. This will prompt you to provide access key, copy and paste the `access key` and then the `secret access key` which is also in the downloaded csv.
When prompted for the region, you can look for region names on the management console. In my case I used **us-east-1**

## Create S3 Buckets
Navigate to **S3** on the management console. Click **Create bucket**, Choose **General purpose** write out <bucket_name>, this name has to be univerally unique from any other bucket names in the AWS. Leave other setting the same on the page. You can uncheck the **Block all public access** section if you want your bucket to be seen by others. You can enable bucket versioning if you require the bucket to keep track of changes made inside it.
